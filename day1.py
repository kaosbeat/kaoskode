'''
so the basic idea is:
    - I write some code, 
    - It generates some gfx, 
    - I push the code to github 
    - the same script makes a blogpost with the output
    - and changes the profilepic of @kaoskode with link to the blog 
    
but we're not there yet

on the way I will learn python, git and explore other stuff
odds are I won't even finish todays session
